# Exploring-Predictive-Techniques-for-Agricultural-Production

The project aims to analyze and compare various machine learning models to forecast agricultural production based on historical data. By leveraging key agricultural parameters such as crop type, season, area, production, rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage, the goal is to provide insights that help farmers and policymakers make informed decisions for improving yield and resource management.
